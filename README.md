# pay-selfservice
GOV.UK Pay Self Service admin tool (Node.js)

## Prerequisites
* This requires the [Pay CLI](https://github.com/alphagov/pay-infra/tree/master/cli), which is not publicly available at present.
* You have [set up your local development environment](https://pay-team-manual.cloudapps.digital/manual/development-processes/setup-local-dev-environment.html)
* Clone this repo locally.

### Running locally

Start the backend services locally in docker, using the Pay CLI.
  
  ```
  pay local launch admin
  ```
 
Generate the environment variables file. This only needs to be done the first time you run locally.
  
  ```
  ./scripts/generate-dev-environment.sh local
  ```
 
Build the Selfservice app and start it

 ```
  npm install && npm run compile
  npm run start:dev
 ```

Open application in browser: 
- http://127.0.0.1:3000

##### Log output
When using Docker, you can view log out with the following command:
```
docker logs -f selfservice
```

#### Debug using Visual Studio Code
* You need to make sure the app runs locally first using the steps in the [Running](#running) section.
* In VSCode, go to the `Debug` view (on MacOS, use shortcut `CMD + shift + D`).
* From the **Run** toolbar, select tne launch config `Self Service`.
* Add breakpoints to any file you want to debug - click in the left hand column and a red dot will appear.
* Press The `green play` button (`F5` MacOS):
    * This will run the app in debug mode.
    * Uses `nodemon` so it will automatically restart on code changes.



#### Watching for changes

You shouldn’t need to restart the app to see changes you make.

We use [nodemon](https://github.com/remy/nodemon) which watches for changes to files and restarts the node process.

If you’re making changes to client-side JS or Sass files (anything within [`/browsered/`](https://github.com/alphagov/pay-selfservice/tree/BAU-update-README-to-explain-livereload/app/browsered) or [`/assets/`](https://github.com/alphagov/pay-selfservice/tree/BAU-update-README-to-explain-livereload/app/assets)) then running `npm run watch-live-reload` will watch for changes and recompile. Nodemon does not do anything here as that’s not necessary. If you install the [livereload browser plugin](http://livereload.com/extensions/) then it will refresh your page once the assets have been compiled to the `/public` folder.

## Running tests

#### To run mocha tests
```
npm run compile && npm test
```
#### Debug tests using Visual Studio Code

##### IMPORTANT NOTE - some tests do not work in debug mode
* Some integration tests do not work in debug mode.  This is because the tests are dependent on other tests running before hand.
* Nevertheless, it is still useful to debug tests that do work in debug mode.

##### Run tests in debug mode
* In VSCode, go to the `Debug` view (on MacOS, use shortcut `CMD + shift + D`).
* From the **Run** toolbar, select the launch config you want to run:
  * `Mocha All` - runs all tests.
  * `Mocha Current File` - only run currently open test file.
* Add breakpoints to any file you want to debug - click in the left hand column and a red dot will appear.
* Press The `green play` button or `F5`.

#### To run cypress tests

Run in two separate terminals:
1. `npm run cypress:server`

    _This runs both the Cypress server and Mountebank which is the virtualisation server used for stubbing out external API calls._

2. Either:
- `npm run cypress:test` to run headless 
- `npm run cypress:test-headed` to run headed
- `npm run cypress:test-no-watch` to run headed with auto-running of tests when the test file is edited turned off

See [About Cypress tests in selfservice](./test/cypress/cypress-testing.md) for more information about running and writing Cypress tests.
