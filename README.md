## Running in Development Mode

Steps are as follows:

1. Use a docker-compose environment to run everything (such as database) that you don't want to develop on right now.
2. Stop `pay-selfservice` in the docker (`docker stop pay-selfservice`), to get ready to run from your checked out copy instead.
3. Use `env.sh` to pick up the same environment variables from `pay-scripts`, so configuration is set correctly, including telling the service here how to communicate with other services that may be running in docker or on your local machine. (This assumes `$WORKSPACE/pay-scripts` exists)

For example:

```
$ ./env.sh npm start
...
(pay-selfservice log output)
...
(press CTRL+C to stop service)
```
