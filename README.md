# pay-selfservice
GOV.UK Pay Self Service admin tool (Node.js)

## Running locally with `pay local`

*This requires the [Pay CLI](https://github.com/alphagov/pay-infra/tree/master/cli), which is not publicly available at present*

* `pay local launch admin`
* Go to: http://localhost:9400

Assuming you're up and running with the [Pay CLI](https://github.com/alphagov/pay-infra/tree/master/cli) and have selfservice running locally you shouldn’t need to restart the app to see changes you make.

We use [nodemon](https://github.com/remy/nodemon) which watches for changes to files and restarts the node process.

You can watch Nodemon do it’s thing if you run `docker logs -f selfservice`.

If you’re making changes to client-side JS or Sass files (anything within [`/browsered/`](https://github.com/alphagov/pay-selfservice/tree/BAU-update-README-to-explain-livereload/app/browsered) or [`/assets/`](https://github.com/alphagov/pay-selfservice/tree/BAU-update-README-to-explain-livereload/app/assets)) then running `npm run watch-live-reload` will watch for changes and recompile. Nodemon does not do anything here as that’s not necessary. If you install the [livereload browser plugin](http://livereload.com/extensions/) then it will refresh your page once the assets have been compiled to the `/public` folder.

## Key environment variables

If you wish to override any variables, please do the following:


Setup
```
cd $WORKSPACE/pay-selfservice/config
cp dev-env.json.example dev-env.json
```


To edit
```
cd ~/workspace/pay-selfservice/config
vi dev-env.json

```

To run mocha tests
```
npm run compile && npm test
```

To run cypress tests

In order to run cypress tests, the pacts server must be running. This uses credentials and setup details found in the `./pacts/` application root directory, running `npm run test` once will run `mocha` tests and generate the `./pacts/` folder. Without this a number of cypress tests will fail. 
```
# ensure `./pacts/` folder exists and is populated (this only needs to be run once)
npm run test
```

Run in three separate terminals:
- `npm run cypress:server`
- `npm run pact-stub`

Running headless:
- `npm run cypress:test` or `$(npm bin)/cypress open`

Running headed: 
- `npm run cypress:test-headed`

_(Note that `ctrl+c` will not close the docker instance started in `npm run pact-stub`. For now this can be stopped with the `docker stop ${INSTANCE_NAME}` command.)_

To run
```
LOCAL_ENV=true msl run

```
