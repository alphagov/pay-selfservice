# pay-selfservice
GOV.UK Pay Self Service admin tool (Node.js)

## Prerequisites
* [Pay CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@govuk-pay/cli)
* You have [set up your local development environment](https://manual.payments.service.gov.uk/manual/development-processes/setup-local-dev-environment.html)

### Running locally

Start the backend services locally in docker, using the Pay CLI.
  
```bash
pay local up --cluster admin
```

Generate the environment variables file. This only needs to be done the first time you run locally.
  
```bash
./scripts/generate-dev-environment.sh local
```

Check that you are using the right version of Node, which should match what specified in package.json for engines/node.

```bash
node -v
```

If the node version is not what specified in package.json, then you need to install it and set it, e.g. for 22.14.0:

```bash
nvm install 22.14.0
nvm use
nvm alias default 22.14.0
```

Run the following in the project root to start the app:

```bash
npm i
npm run dev
 ```

Open the application in browser: 
- http://127.0.0.1:3000

#### Watching for changes

The local development server (`npm run dev`) will watch for any changes to files in the `src` directory and rebuild the bundles automatically.

Any changes to the server code will restart the app; changes to client side assets (SCSS/JS) and Nunjucks views will be reloaded automatically without a restart.

### Running via Pay CLI

```bash
pay local up --cluster admin --mount-local-node-apps --local selfservice
```
This command will watch changes in your workspace and rebuild them in a Pay CLI managed `selfservice` task

## Running tests

#### To run tests

```bash
npm run test
```
This command will run all [mocha](https://mochajs.org/) test suites matching the glob patterns `*.test.js` or `*.test.ts`

To run Cypress tests start the server in a separate terminal

```bash
npm run cypress:server
```
    
_This runs both the Cypress server and @govuk-pay/run-amock which is the mock server used for stubbing out external API calls._

You can run Cypress tests headless or in a locally installed browser

```bash
npm run cypress:test # headless
npm run cypress:test-headed # in a browser
```

#### Debugging Cypress tests

You can start the Cypress server with in-line source maps and auto reload enabled by running `npm run cypress:dev-server`. 
This will allow you to set breakpoints and step through the source when running a spec.
