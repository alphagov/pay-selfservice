      (“GDS”, “we”, “us”, “our”).
    </p>

  <p class="govuk-body">
      Public sector organisations use GOV.UK Pay to take payments online and over the phone. To do
      that, we collect, process and store certain data about paying users and public sector users.

  <p class="govuk-body">
      When a public sector organisation wants to use GOV.UK Pay, you, as the employee will need to
      create an account on GOV.UK Pay. We collect and process data about you, your colleagues and
      your organisation in order to facilitate the set up of payment services and the taking and
      managing of payments from your users.

  </ul>

  <p class="govuk-body">
      We also record a user’s permission level which determines the activity and
      data any invited user has access to. When you request to make your payment
      service live on GOV.UK Pay, with our payment provider Stripe, we require
      the following additional information:
    </p>

  <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>your organisation’s bank details</li>
    <li>your organisation’s VAT number (if applicable)</li>

  <h2 class="govuk-heading-m" id="what-we-do-with-your-data">What we do with your data</h2>

  <p class="govuk-body">
      To carry out our responsibilities to the public sector organisation that uses GOV.UK Pay, we will need

  <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>ensure that the GOV.UK Pay service operates as expected</li>
    <li>allow paying users to make one-off single payments to your service and organisation</li>
    <li>allow paying users to make and manage recurring payments with you service and organisation</li>
    <li>allow you and other employees to log in and administer payments and refunds</li>
    <li>respond to any queries raised by the organisation or the payment provider in respect of the service</li>

  <h2 class="govuk-heading-m" id="who-your-data-might-be-shared-with">Who your data might be shared with</h2>

  <p class="govuk-body">
      There are times when we need to share your data.
    </p>

  <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Payment provider / Financial regulations</h3>

  <p class="govuk-body">
      If you are a payer, your personal data will be provided to the relevant PSP that’s connected to the government
      organisation you are paying. You can find their privacy notices here:

    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Third party service providers</h3>

  <p class="govuk-body">
      We will share your personal data with third parties if they need to know the information so that they can provide
      us, or the relevant government organisation, with a service. For example, a supplier of IT services like data
      storage.
    </p>

  <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Legal and regulatory entities</h3>

  <p class="govuk-body">
      We may have to share your personal data with law enforcement agencies or regulatory
      bodies if we have to comply with any legal obligation or court order.
    </p>

  <p class="govuk-body">
      These other entities may be based in the UK or they might be located in other countries that are not in
      the European Economic Area (“EEA”). Different privacy laws apply across the world. We will only transfer
      your data to another country if we are sure that there is enough protection in place to make sure that
      your data is secure.
    </p>

  <p class="govuk-body">
      We design, build and run our systems to make sure that your data is as safe as possible at any stage, both while
      it’s processed and when it’s stored.
    </p>

  <p class="govuk-body">
      Your personal data may, throughout the course of its processing at GDS, be transferred outside the UK. Where this
      is the case all appropriate technical and legal safeguards will be put in place to make sure that you are
      afforded the same level of protection as within the UK.
    </p>

  <p class="govuk-body">
      We will not:
    </p>

  <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>sell or rent your data to third parties</li>
    <li>share your data with third parties for marketing purposes</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 class="govuk-heading-m" id="how-we-protect-your-data-and-keep-it-secure">How we protect your data and keep it secure</h2>

  <p class="govuk-body">
      We are committed to doing all that we can to keep your data secure. We set up systems and processes to prevent
      unauthorised access or disclosure of the data we collect about you – for example, we protect your data using
      varying levels of encryption. All third parties who process personal data for GDS are required to keep that data
      secure. From time to time we will test the system for security vulnerabilities.
    </p>

  <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">What are your rights</h3>

  <p class="govuk-body">
      You have the right to:
    </p>

  <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>information about how your personal data is processed</li>
    <li>a copy of that personal data</li>
