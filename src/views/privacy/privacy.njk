      GOV.UK Pay is a payments service that’s built and maintained by the
      Government Digital Service, which is part of the Cabinet Office
      (“GDS”, “we”, “us”, “our”).
    </p>

    <p class="govuk-body">
      Public sector organisations use GOV.UK Pay to take payments online and over the phone. To do
      that, we collect, process and store certain data about paying users and public sector users.
    </p>

    <p class="govuk-body">
      People making payments to a public sector organisation should refer to our

    <p class="govuk-body">
      When a public sector organisation wants to use GOV.UK Pay, you, as the employee will need to
      create an account on GOV.UK Pay. We collect and process data about you, your colleagues and
      your organisation in order to facilitate the set up of payment services and the taking and
      managing of payments from your users.

    <p class="govuk-body">
      We also record a user’s permission level which determines the activity and
      data any invited user has access to. When you request to make your payment
      service live on GOV.UK Pay, with our payment provider Stripe, we require
      the following additional information:
    </p>

    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>your organisation’s bank details</li>
      <li>your organisation’s VAT number (if applicable)</li>

      If you are an individual who holds a director and/or responsible person
      role we will also collect the following personal data about you to enable

    <p class="govuk-body">
      We design, build and run our systems to make sure that your data is as safe as possible at any stage, both
      while it’s processed and when it’s stored. We are committed to doing all that we can to keep your data secure.
      We set up systems and processes to prevent unauthorised access or disclosure of the data we collect about
      you – for example, we protect your data using varying levels of encryption. All third parties who process
      personal data for GDS are required to keep that data secure. From time to time we will test the system
      for security vulnerabilities.
    </p>

    <p class="govuk-body">
      Your personal data may, throughout the course of its processing at GDS, be transferred outside the UK. Where
      this is the case all appropriate technical and legal safeguards will be put in place to make sure that you are
      afforded the same level of protection as within the UK. We will only transfer your data to another country if
      we are sure that there is enough protection in place to make sure that your data is secure.
